# Monster Stats

Each of these files is copied from an official source (mostly the
[Monster Manual](http://dnd.wizards.com/products/tabletop-games/rpg-products/monster-manual)),
and put in a form that can be pasted into [homebrewery](http://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/).

The intention is that, for a given adventure or campaign, you can print out the stats
for the monsters you will be using, for quick reference and notes.
